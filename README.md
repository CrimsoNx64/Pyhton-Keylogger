Just run the Python program and whatever you or your victim type will be put into the text file
You may get an error saying you dont have pynput installed
To fix
1. download "Pycharm" 
2. Put main.py into it
3. Click on "pynput.keyboard" on the line "from pynput.keyboard import Listener"
4. It should install the pynput and now the program should work
Have fun and check out my other programs!!
